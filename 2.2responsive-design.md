## Lesson 1. Why responsive

### 01. Sites On Mobile

Pete LePage, front-end advocate at Google
Cameron Pittman, course developer at Udacity

Google News uses a fully responsive layout for mobile, and a less responsive version for desktops. They have to maintain the two different versions. The Skinny Ties site is always fully responsive. I also found the creator of the Skinny Ties site, [Gravity Department](http://gravitydept.com/).

### 02. Quiz: Share Your Great & Awful Sites

Responsive sites

- curator.io
- material.io

Instructor answer:

- alistapart.com

### 03. Intro to Project

- Cameron mentioned "lessons 2, 4, and 5," which I think is in reference to the standalone responsive design course.
- We will have to make a website responsive.
- Think responsive from the start.

### 04. Pan, Zoom, Touch, Ick

### 05. Emulators, Simulators and Real Devices

[https://www.browserstack.com/](https://www.browserstack.com/)

### 06. Setting up Chrome's Dev Tools

Click the mobile icon in Chrome's developer tools to view a mobile version.

From [Google](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/):

> The core foundations of a delightful web experience are...
>
> - **Fast** - It respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.
> - **Integrated** - The user doesnâ€™t have to reach through the browser, it uses the full capabilities of the device to create an experience true to the device.
> - **Reliable** - Load instantly and reliably, never showing the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.
> - **Engaging** - Keeps the user coming back to the app with beautifully designed experiences that look and feel natural.

### 07. IMPORTANT! Udacity Front End Feedback Extension

### 08. Quiz: Device Emulation

We added a custom device emulation into Chrome Developer Tools.

### 09. Remote Debugging Intro

Debugging in Chrome for Android

### 10. Setup for mobile

- Android developer mode: go to device settings, click on build number seven times (seriously).
- USB debugging: usually in developer options on device. After turning on, connect USB to desktop,
- Chrome: install chrome canary on desktop, chrome beta on android.

## Lesson 2. Starting Small

### 01. Defining the Viewport

The Viewport defines the area of the screen that the browser can render content to.

### 02. Pixels, pixels and moar pixels

- "A pixel isn't always a pixel."
- **Browsers report width in Device Independent Pixels (DIPs). DIPs take up the same amount of space, regardless of the device's pixel density.**
- The browser must be told that the site was designed to work on a small screen, or it will render the page at full DIPs as if it were on a desktop.

### 03. Quiz: Pixelation

- Pixel measurements in web development are complicated.
- Tech specs typically refer to hardware pixels, so a 1080p mobile screen will have 1920px x 1080px.

### 04. Quiz: Calculating DPR

- **Device Pixel Ratio (DPR)** of 2: one DIP for every two hardware pixels.

### 05. Quiz: What's the difference

- *why would a site with the same HTML and CSS render differently on two devices?- -> Viewport may need to be set, and DPR may be different.

### 06. Quiz: Calculating CSS Pixels

> Right! Divide 1920px by 2 and you get a viewport width of 960 CSS pixels.

### 07. Quiz: How wide is the viewport

We just calculated the DIPs for each device, given hardware pixels and DPR.

### 08. Setting the Viewport

- Udacity: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
- The viewport tag is actually not standardized yet. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag).

### 09. Quiz: Setting the Viewport

- We added a viewport to Cameron's website to make it responsive.
- See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) for a refresher on the meta tag.

### 10. Large Fixed Width Elements

- Need to have images resize with the viewport.
- Use relative units (100%).
- I used relative units in the General Assembly Dash website projects.

### 11. Max-width on elements

Include a catch-all in your CSS:

```css
img, embed, object, video {
    max-width: 100%;
}
```

### 12. Quiz: Relative Sizes

### 13. Tap Target Sizes

- Tap targets need to be large enough to be easy to hit on mobile devices.
- CSS pixels: 48 px x 48 px is generally large enough for tap targets.

### 14. Quiz: Tap Targets

```css
nav a, button {
    min-width: 48px;
    min-height: 48px;
}
```

### 15. Start Small

- Design your site with the smallest screen in mind first.
- `#PerfMatters`

### 16. Quiz: Project Part 1

- I downloaded the files and edited in Sublime text instead of Chrome Dev Tools so I could save the changes easily.
- Steps:
  - *add meta viewport tag:- copy and paste `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` into the HTML head
  - *single column and relative widths:- replace `float` in top-level element CSS with `display: block;`, add `width: 100%`
  - *touch targets:- modified the `.nav_item` CSS to include `min-width: 48px; min-height: 48px;`
  - *test across different viewports:- done
- My solution actually looks better than the Udacity solution:
  - My header nav buttons are centered on mobile devices, like iPhone 5, their buttons are not.
  - Their header doesn't extend the full width of the device

### Project Solution - Long

I didn't need to watch this because I got the solution on my own.

### Lesson 2 Summary

## Lesson 3. Building Up

### 01. Lesson Intro

A responsive website applies styles based on the characteristics of the device. In order to make a site fully responsive, we need to think about the entire design.

### 02. Basic Media Query Intro

Include an additional stylesheet with a media query. Also see GA_wdi_03_business.html, where I included a media query.

```css
@media (max-width: 500px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 50px;
    margin-top: 20px;
    line-height: 40px;
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: 20px;
    margin: 20px 0 30px 0;
  }
  div {
    margin: 20px 12px 0 12px;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 12px;
    line-height: 24px;
    width: 90%;
  }
  small {
    font-size: 10px;
  }
}
```

### 03. Adding a Basic Media Query

In GA_wdi_03_business.html, we created a media query to resize the site on screens <500px. Here, we will set up a media query that activates when the screen is >500px. We add a new stylesheet, and link to it in the site HTML.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width:500px)" href="over500.css">
```

**Stick with `media="screen"` or `media="print"`. Other types didn't gain traction.**

### 04. Adding a basic media query 2

- As in the GA_wdi_03_business.html example, we will embed the media query with an `@media` tag. Avoid the `@import` tag "for performance reasons."
- Weigh the costs between linked CSS (many small http requests) and `@media` (few large http requests)

### 05. Next Step Media Queries

- `min-width` and `max-width` are most frequently used.
- `min-device-width` and `max-device-width` are strongly discouraged. They are based on the size of the total screen, not the viewport.

### 06. Quiz: Which styles are applied

We made some changes to the `<style type="text/css"></style>` section of the `<head></head>` of the sample site, to apply different colors to the <`body></body>` depending on the. Cameron mentioned that it was easier to write the code in Sublime Text and paste it in.

```html
<style type="text/css">
  h1 {
    position: absolute;
    text-align: center;
    width: 100%;
    font-size: 6em;
    font-family: Roboto;
    transition: all 0.5s;
  }
  @media screen and (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 400px) {
    body {
      background-color: red;
    }
  }
  @media screen and (min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
      background-color: green;
    }
  }
  @media screen and (min-width: 600px) {
    body {
      background-color: blue;
    }
  }
</style>
```

### 07. Breakpoints

A **breakpoint** is the point at which the site changes layout.

### 08. Breakpoints Pt. II

Cameron starts with skinnyties.com. He calls the three bar nav icon a "**hamburger**."

### 09. Quiz: Number of Breakpoints

- Example site has two: 500px, 600px
- Medium.com has two breakpoints, 768px, 992px.

### 10. Picking Breakpoints

Breakpoints should not be defined based on a specific device. **Define breakpoints based on content.**

> We shouldn't choose breakpoints at all. Instead, we should find them, using our content as a guide.

Scott Yale

### 11. Picking Breakpoints 2

[Video](https://youtu.be/17XgkPFq6eY)

Again, start with smallest first. In all our examples, we have had two breakpoints to create three viewports: small, medium, large.

### 12. Quiz: Pick a Breakpoint

I looked at the content, particularly the tables, and picked 600px as a breakpoint.

### 13. Complex Media Queries

### 14. Quiz: What Styles Are Applied

<img src="img/fsnd01_19_1401.png" alt="Practice with media queries" width="75%">

### 15. Grids

They mentioned fluid grids, and how Bootstrap is a pre-made fluid grid layout.

### 16. Flexbox Intro

Use flexboxes for responsive grid layouts.

### 17. Flexbox Container

- `display: flex;`. The default flex direction is row.
- `flex-wrap: wrap;` allows elements to wrap to the next line.

### 18. Flex Item

Set order of elements with an `order attribute`

### 19. Deconstructing a Flexbox Layout
