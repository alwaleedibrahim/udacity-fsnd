## 02. Quiz: Embarrassing story

When I heard Kunal's story
of accidentally sending a curse word to his boss because he typed the wrong
letter, I immediately thought of text auto-correct and looked up the history of
its development. Wired had a [good
article](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/history-of-autocorrect/). It was
developed by Dean Hachamovitch, head of data science at Microsoft. There is an
[autocorrect program on PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autocorrect/0.3.0).
## 03. Quiz: Planning Profanity Editor

* Create a list of words, like
Microsoft's “Words which should neither be flagged nor suggested” from the
[Wired article](https://www.wired.com/2014/07/history-of-autocorrect), and
replacements.
* Find the words in the file
* Replace words with replacements.
## 04. Reading from a File

Starting to code: read text from a file with
`<file>.read()`.

"It just blows my mind that we can read from a text file with
only a few lines of code." Kunal

```python
def read_text():
    """Read the contents of a text file."""
    quotes = open('movie_quotes.txt')
    contents_of_file = quotes.read()
    print(contents_of_file)
    quotes.close()

read_text()

```

## 05. Quiz: Place Function `open`

*Where do you think `open` resides?* -> I
guessed correctly by looking at the code. It's in the standard library, but
separate from `os`.

Functions like `open` are so commonly used, that they are
always available. They don't require a separate `import` command.


## 06.
Reading Open Documentation

## 07. Connecting Turtles and Open

`open` is one of
the [built-in
functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=built). It
mentions objects. 

> Open file and return a corresponding [file
object](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object).  


*Where
have we come across this before?* -> in the previous lesson on classes. An
object is an instance of a class. Open, like Turtle, is calling some
`__init__`-like function.

> "Being able to read documentation and experimenting
with Python is a big part of learning to program." Kunal

## 08. Quiz: Built-In Python Functions

*1. Pick a built-in Python function.
Read through its documentation.*

*2. Use it in a new program and share your
experience on the forum.*

I took a look at the built-in functions and selected
`tuple()`. I'm still not clear on what a `tuple` is, so it's a good chance to
learn.

### tuple starts

A `tuple` is not really a function, but actually a type of
ordered data structure (see the Python documentation [4.6. Sequence Types —
list, tuple, range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-
types-list-tuple-range)). It can contain both numbers and text strings, enclosed
in parentheses and separated by commas. It's immutable, meaning that you can't
modify it after creation (unlike dictionaries, which are mutable).

From the
[documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=built#func-
tuple):

> <p>Rather than being a function, <a class="reference internal"
href="stdtypes.html#tuple" title="tuple"><code class="xref py py-class docutils
literal"><span class="pre">tuple</span></code></a> is actually an immutable
sequence type, as documented in <a class="reference internal"
href="stdtypes.html#typesseq-tuple"><span class="std std-ref">Tuples</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="stdtypes.html#typesseq"><span class="std
std-ref">Sequence Types — list, tuple, range</span></a>.</p>

*Note that the
`cmp()` function referenced on
[Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.htm) was
[removed in Python
3](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html?highlight=cmp#the-old-way-using-
the-cmp-parameter).*

There are some built-in functions that can be used with
tuples. I wrote some code that compares two tuples. I created tuples with
identity information for two fearsome beasts from Star Wars: the
[Rancor](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rancor) and the
[Sarlacc](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sarlacc). Which one is taller? The
Rancor might look taller, but the Sarlacc extends deep beneath the sands. Let's
create a function to compare heights:

```python
# tuples: name, age in years, homeworld, height in meters, diet

sarlacc = ('Sarlacc', 30000, 'Tatooine', 100, 'omnivorous')

rancor = ('Rancor', 'unknown', 'Dathomir', 5, 'carnivorous')

if rancor[3] > sarlacc[3]:
    print('Rancor is taller!')
elif sarlacc[3] > rancor[3]:
    print('Sarlacc is taller!')

```

### tuple struggles

I experimented with different ways of creating the tuples.

```python
name = 'Sarlacc'
age = 30000
homeworld = 'Tatooine'
height = 100

# combine the objects into a tuple
Sarlacc = (name, age, homeworld, height)
print(Sarlacc, len(Sarlacc))

# return the third entry in the tuple
# remember the tuple starts at 0, so this will be homeworld
Sarlacc[2]

```

I tried something similar to the `student_tuples` example in the "[Sorting HOW
TO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html?highlight=cmp#sorting-how-to)"
section of the Python 3 documentation. This creates a list with two tuples. It
was difficult to work with because I couldn't slice the individual tuples.

```python
# creates a list of two tuples
star_wars_beasts = [
('Rancor', 'unknown', 'Dathomir', 5, 'carnivorous'), 
('Sarlacc', 30000, 'Tatooine', 100, 'omnivorous')
]
print(star_wars_beasts[0][0])
```

It was better to create two separate tuples. It is possible to do this in the
same line of code, but the code will not be PEP 8 compliant.

```python
# creates two separate tuples on the same line
Sarlacc, Rancor = (30000, 'Tatooine', 100, 'omnivorous'), ('unknown', 'Dathomir', 5, 'carnivorous')
print(Sarlacc, '\n' ,Rancor)
```

*What if I want to combine the objects into a tuple, so I can add another and
still use the original names?*

**I NEED A DICT!** 

See python-cf17-02-language
and GA_python101.Rmd

Here's the dict:

```python
Sarlacc = {'name': 'Sarlacc', 'age, years': 30000, 'homeworld': 'Tatooine', 'height, meters': 100}
print(Sarlacc['homeworld'])
```

## 09. Checking for Curse Words

### Next step with the code

Now we need to
scan the contents of the file for curse words. We can use the `urllib.urlopen`
function from the standard library to open the wdylike site.

```python
import
urllib


def read_text():
    """Read the contents of a text file."""
    quotes
= open('movie_quotes.txt')
    contents_of_file = quotes.read()
print(contents_of_file)
    quotes.close()
    check_profanity(contents_of_file)
def check_profanity(text_to_check):
    """Check the text file for profanity."""
connection = urllib.urlopen('http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q='+text_to_check)
output = connection.read()
    print(output)
    connection.close()
read_text()

```

### Instructor notes

Checking for Curse Words

1. [Using What
Do You Love to check curse words](http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q=shot)
2. [In
case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) you are curious about the
things we are adding after the ? in the link or URL


### Comments

**This
exercise would have made more sense if I understood HTTP requests. We didn't go
through HTTP requests until part 2 (developer tools).**

**I was actually
curious about the `?q=shot` text in the link above. This is the query. It's
asking the website if "shot" is a curse word. Google discontinued the wdyl site,
but this site returns a plaintext response: true if the word is a curse word,
and false if it's not. I tried this out before watching the video, and caught on
to it.**

**It was also striking to find that, as of 2011, 96% of Google's
revenue comes from AdWords, their advertising service.**

## 10. Accessing a Website with Code

**The code didn't run at first:**
`AttributeError: module 'urllib' has no attribute 'urlopen'`

**I searched the
Python documentation for `urlopen`. The syntax is slightly different now.**
Corrected version:

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen


def
read_text():
    """Read the contents of a text file."""
    quotes =
open('movie_quotes.txt')
    contents_of_file = quotes.read()
print(contents_of_file)
    quotes.close()
    check_profanity(contents_of_file)
def check_profanity(text_to_check):
    """Check the text file for profanity."""
connection = urlopen('http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q=' + text_to_check)
output = connection.read()
    print(output)
    connection.close()
read_text()

```

I'm also getting an `HTTPError: HTTP Error 400: Bad Request`.
I ran a quick search and found a fix on [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8840303/urllib2-http-
error-400-bad-request), but the fix is outdated and didn't work for me.

See
below for solution.

## 11. Quiz: Place urllib and urlopen

within the standard library. urlopen is a
function within urllib.

## 12. Reading urllib Documentation

## 13. Printing a Better Output

Added a few lines of code to print clear
feedback on the result:

```python
from urllib.request import urlopen


def
read_text():
    """Read the contents of a text file."""
    quotes =
open('movie_quotes.txt')
    contents_of_file = quotes.read()
print(contents_of_file)
    quotes.close()
    check_profanity(contents_of_file)
def check_profanity(text_to_check):
    """Check the text file for profanity."""
connection = urlopen('http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q=' + text_to_check)
output = connection.read()
    print(output)
    connection.close()
    if
'true' in output:
        print("Profanity Alert!")
    elif "false" in output:
print("This document has no curse words!")


read_text()

```

## 14. Quiz: Profanity Editor Mini-Project

### Code with `urllib.request` module

I adapted the code for Python 3.6.2 and
made it as concise as possible. My code was initially returning `HTTPError: HTTP
Error 400: Bad Request`. There is another Udacian, tb7459, who got around this
by replacing spaces with `%20` (ASCII spaces). The ASCII spaces can also be seen
in the website url after [like
this](http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q=i%20can%20take%20a%20shit%20at%20it).
I rewrote my code, making it a little more concise by directly importing
`urlopen`.

```python
# Profanity checker mini-project
# Code without Requests

from urllib.request import urlopen


def read_text():
    """Read the contents of a text file."""
    quotes = open('movie_quotes.txt')
    contents_of_file = quotes.read()
    print(contents_of_file)
    quotes.close()
    check_profanity(contents_of_file)


def check_profanity(text_to_check):
    """Check the text file for profanity."""
    # ascii spaces
    text_to_check = text_to_check.replace(' ', '%20')
    text_to_check = text_to_check.replace('\n', '%20')
    # web query
    connection = urlopen('http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q=' + text_to_check)
    output = str(connection.read())
    connection.close()
    # output
    if 'true' in output:
        print('Profanity Alert!')
    elif 'false' in output:
        print('This document has no curse words!')
    else:
        print('Could not scan the document properly.')


read_text()

```

### Code with Requests module

**I noted that the [Python
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html) recommends
the [Requests module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) instead, so I
rewrote the code for Requests.** The author of Requests, Kenneth Reitz, is an
interesting and talented person, and I enjoyed checking out his [personal
website](https://www.kennethreitz.org/).

I was able to pass the text directly
to Requests without converting to ASCII spaces. The web query only requires one
line with the `requests.get()` function, and the text response from the website
can be referenced without creating an additional variable with the `r.text`
function. 

Note that I was initially working with the "response status code"
from the `requests.get()` function, which was not necessary. I was getting
`<Response [200]>`, True, with or without profanity. A True response code just
means that a response was received from the website. In order to actually return
the text string from the website, I needed `r.text`.

```python
# Profanity checker mini-project
# Code rewritten for Requests

import requests


def read_text():
    """Read the contents of a text file."""
    quotes = open('movie_quotes.txt')
    contents_of_file = quotes.read()
    print(contents_of_file)
    quotes.close()
    check_profanity(contents_of_file)


def check_profanity(text_to_check):
    """Check the text file for profanity."""
    # web query
    r = requests.get('http://www.wdylike.appspot.com/?q=' + text_to_check)
    # output
    if 'true' in r.text:
        print('Profanity Alert!')
    elif 'false' in r.text:
        print('This document has no curse words!')
    else:
        print('Could not scan the document properly.')


read_text()

```

### Comments

I shared my progress with my family over the phone.

I also note
that this program is just a profanity *checker*, not really an editor. We're not
actually replacing the profanity strings with alternatives.

## 15. Connecting Turtle, Open, and Urllib

In each case, we have been working
with objects.

`brad = turtle.Turtle`: brad is an object of turtle
`quotes =
open(File)`: quotes is an object of file
`connection = urllib.urlopen()`: a
"file-like object"

**Remember, classes are like blueprints, and objects are
like specific instances of the blueprint.**

## Feedback

* This was a helpful and educational exercise.
* This exercise
would have made more sense if I understood HTTP requests. We didn't go through
HTTP requests until part 2 (developer tools).
* The program is just a profanity
*checker*, not really an editor. We're not actually replacing the profanity
strings with alternatives. The project could have included an autocorrect-type
feature.
