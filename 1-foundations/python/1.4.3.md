Lesson 3. Making Classes

## 02. Take a Break (story)

We want to remind people to take breaks while they
are spending long hours on the computer!

**This take a break project is a nice
example of how to build a computer program by breaking the objective down into a
series of actionable steps, then testing each step.**

## 03. Take a Break
(output)
    
    
## 04. How would you do this?

If you were writing the "Take
a Break" program, what steps would you take to get to the output?

1. Track the
time
    * import a module that follows the computer's clock
2. After two hours:
open browser to play song
    * write a command to open browser, and include
link to YouTube video
3. Repeat in two more hours

## 06. one way of doing this

Create a loop to repeat three times:
*
Wait two hours
* Open browser

## 07. Launching python

Already rocking jupyter
## 08. Quiz: what is the error?

We will use the [`webbrowser`
function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html?highlight=webbrowser#module-
webbrowser) in the standard library.

I decided to play the song "Hours" by
Tycho. Very appropriate for this example.

*I tried the code before playing the
instructional video:*

got it to work on the command line first:

```bash
$
python -m webbrowser -t "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuGO6WHcruU"
```

```python
# have to import the webbrowser module for jupyter
import webbrowser
webbrowser.open_new_tab("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuGO6WHcruU")
```

## 09. Squashing the bug

Kunal gets the same error in his instructional video.
Already figured it out!

## 10. Making the program wait

```python
import time
import webbrowser
time.sleep(7) 
# try 7 seconds. 
# For two hours, time.sleep(2*60*60)
webbrowser.open_new_tab("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuGO6WHcruU")
```

See
[Tutorialspoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/time_sleep.htm) for more.

## 11. Break timer loop quiz and programming milestone

**My independent
completion of this quiz was my first programming milestone.**

I tried this
before watching the video. I decided to use a `for` loop. See [this Stack
Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17647907/for-or-while-
loop-to-do-something-n-times) for a comparison of `for` and `while` loops. 

I
got the `for` loop version to run correctly on my first try:

```python
import
time
import webbrowser

for i in range(3):
    time.sleep(7) # try 7 seconds.
For 2 hours, use 2*60*60.
webbrowser.open_new_tab("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuGO6WHcruU")
```

I
don't like the suggestion of `while` loops here. It would make more sense to me
syntactically to use a `for` loop. When formatting as a `while` loop, I
initially got stuck in an infinite loop, which I stopped by pressing `Esc` to
enter command mode, and then `i,i` to interrupt the kernel. In order to run this
as a `while` loop, you have to create a superfluous reference of integers, then
add 1 to the count each time.

Breaks have to be counted each time, as Kunal did
in his example. He requires three additional lines of code to perform the same
function:

```python
import time
import webbrowser

total_breaks = 3
break_count
= 0 # starting point 

while(break_count < total_breaks):
    time.sleep(7) #
try 7 seconds
webbrowser.open_new_tab("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuGO6WHcruU")
break_count = break_count + 1 # add 1 each time, to stop at 3 and avoid infinite
loop
```

**I am already learning to think in the most efficient way possible in
Python! I'm becoming a programmer!**

The current time on the instructor's
computer is Wednesday February 12 16:40:40 2014. I picked up here on Wednesday
at 16:20!

He also added a timestamp:

```python
print('This program started on
' + time.ctime())
```

```python
# break timer
import time
import webbrowser


for i in range(3):
    time.sleep(7) # try 7 seconds. For 2 hours, use 2*60*60.
    webbrowser.open_new_tab("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuGO6WHcruU")
    
```

## 12. Making the Program Wait Longer

Already figured this out. the
`time.sleep()` function takes in seconds, so `time.sleep(2*60*60)`.

## 13. Where Does Webbrowser Come From?

`webbrowser` and `time` are part of the
Python Standard Library. We don't see exactly how they communicate with the
operating system to function. This hiding of detail is called **abstraction.** I
am familiar with abstraction from David Evans' [cs4414: Operating
Systems](http://rust-class.org/) class.

## 14. Reading Webbrowser Documentation
## 15. Take a Break Mini-Project

## 18. Secret Message (story)

We have to rename files on the computer. The
files have location names and numbers in them. The numbers are either at the
beginnning or end of the file name, and contain 1-3 digits.

They spelled
"Edinbrough" incorrectly.

## 19. Secret Message (output)

The output is file
names without numbers in them.

## 20. Quiz: Planning a Secret Message

What
steps would you take to remove numbers from a bunch of file names on your
computer?

* This is a standard task that they mention in the Python
documentation tutorial under "[1. Whetting Your
Appetite](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html?highlight=rename)."
Just looking at the documentation and thinking about it:
* Define a function:
* Point Python to the directory where the files are located.
    * Ask Python to
remove numbers from the name string of each file, in the `range(9)`. This could
maybe be done with a clear() or del() command. We could potentially use the
[`os.path()`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib2.html?highlight=rename#templating),
[`path.rename()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html?highlight=rename#pathlib.Path.rename),
or
[`os.rename()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=rename#os.rename)
functions.
* Loop the function for each file in the directory.

We had to post
our responses in the forum, but the link was old and the thread was locked. I
found an open thread, with the title [Planning a secret
messge](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/planning-a-secret-messge) (yes,
message was spelled incorrectly).


Kunal's steps:

1. Get file names
2. `For`
each file, rename by removing numbers


## 21. Opening a File

</div>

He googled "find file names in a
folder in Python" and clicked the Stack Overflow page. They reference the
`os.listdir` function.

We started constructing our function:

```python
import
os


def rename_files():
    # (1) get file names from a folder
    file_list =
os.listdir('<path-to-prank-directory>')
    print(file_list)

```

## 22. Quiz: Changing Filenames

Kunal suggested searching the Python
documentation for the `os` module. Already
[there](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=rename#os.rename)!
I easily got the correct answer to this quiz.

> Great Job
>
> Yes! Reading
documentation is a key skill and takes effort to acquire. You are beginning to
practice a key attribute of an expert programmer.

## 23. Checking os Documentation

The resources section below recommends using
the `<string>.translate()` function. I anticipated this need, because we are
removing numbers from the file name, but the numbers are embedded within the
string of the file name. We need a function to parse the file name.

Kunal
starts typing the `for` loop, then goes to the shell window to test out some
commands. 

Try it in the shell first with a string to imitate the file name:
```bash
python
>>> file_name = '48athens.jpg'
>>> translation_table =
str.maketrans('0123456789', '          ', '0123456789')
>>>
file_name.translate(translation_table)
'athens.jpg'
```

Python 3 requires a
separate step for construction of the translation table (see Resources section
below). The second argument is just an empty string of ten spaces (length equal
to the numbers string). I initially tried this with the `range(9)` function to
be more concise, but didn't get the correct result.

This works regardless of
the position of the numbers in the file name.

Note that we will have to define
the variable `file_name` for the list of files in the folder.

<p><b> More
information on  the string function translate</b><br>
Let us understand the
documentation for <code>string.translate</code></p>
<p>In the python
documentation for string translate, you will see </p>
<p><code>string.translate(s, table[, deletechars])</code></p>
<p>Notice that
there are three argments (or inputs to the
function), <em>s</em>,
<em>table</em>, and the optional <em>deletechars</em> (we know it's
optional
because it's in square brackets). But only two are shown in
the video:
<em>table</em> and <em>deletechars</em>. Don't worry, this will be
explained
later. For now, learn this little trick, doing this:</p>
<p><code>import
string</code></p>
<p><code>string.translate(file_name,None,'0123456789')</code></p>
<p>is
equivalent to doing this (putting <code>file_name</code> out front, in place of
the <code>string</code> module):</p>
<p><code>file_name.translate(None,'0123456789')</code></p>
<p><strong>Python 3
Note</strong></p>
<p>String translation changed in the transition from Python
2.7 to Python 3. The translation table is now separate from the
<code>translate()</code> function itself. To do this kind of translation in
Python 3, you will need to create a translation table, and pass that into the
<code>translate()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-
python">translation_table = str.maketrans(<span class="hljs-
string">"0123456789"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"          "</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">"0123456789"</span>)
filename.translate(translation_table)
</code></pre>

</div></div>

## 24. Renaming Files

We can run the `<string>.translate()` function within the
`os.rename` function.

## 25. Quiz: What Is the Error?

I thought the error would be that we have not
yet defined the variable `file_name` for the list of files in the folder. 

##
26. Quiz: Squashing the Bug 

The error was actually that he was in the
directory above the desired folder. 

He wrote some code within the
`rename_files()` function to check and save the current directory:

```python
saved_path = os.getcwd()
print('Current working directory is ' + saved_path)
```
Then, at the end of the `rename_files()` function, he returned to the directory:
```python
os.chdir(saved_path)
```

At first, I thought this wouldn't be
necessary, because `os.chdir()` can be used to specify the correct directory
before the loop to rename files. The problem is that Python remembers the
directory when it is changed. It also follows the directory when it moves, so if
you move the folder to the trash, the directory will be pointing to the trash.
Saving the path as an object and returning there at the end of the code ensures
that Python is looking at the expected directory.

*Why do we need to repeat the
number string in the str.maketrans() function?* -> If you delete the second
number string, there will be spaces in the file name. If you delete the string
of spaces, and leave the two number strings, nothing happens.

*What is
`file_name`?* -> It's possible that the string function actually has `file_name`
pre-defined.

## Secret message example full code

```python
import os


def rename_files():
    """Remove numbers from a list of image files."""
    # Save current working directory
    saved_path = os.getcwd()
    print('Current working directory is ' + saved_path)

    # Get file names from a folder
    os.chdir('img/prank')
    file_list = os.listdir()
    print(file_list)

    # For each file, rename filename
    for file_name in file_list:
        # construct translation table for the translate function
        t_table = str.maketrans('0123456789', '          ', '0123456789')
        # rename file with new name
        os.rename(file_name, file_name.translate(t_table))

    # Display list of renamed files
    renamed_files = os.listdir()
    print(renamed_files)

    # Return to previous working directory
    os.chdir(saved_path)
    print('Directory changed back to ' + os.getcwd())


rename_files()

```

**Success! Viewing the files in name order reveals the secret message: 'KEYS ARE
IN THE CLOSET. BEHIND THE SHOEBOX.'**

I kept the zipped image directory. Unzip
for easy access to the original files when re-running the code.

## 27. Quiz: Rename Troubles

What would happen if:
    a) we tried to rename a
file that doesn't exist? -> code returns an error
    b) we tried to rename a
file to a name that already exists in the folder? -> code runs, but nothing is
changed.
    
**Exceptions** tell Python what to do if it encounters an error.
Resources section on exceptions:

> In case you are curious, here is some
information on
[Exceptions](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_exceptions.htm). This
is an advanced topic in object oriented programming. We will uncover several of
these in Lesson 3b. We are still working on creating the best introduction to
Exceptions. In the meantime, the link above should help you get started.

## 28. Where Does `os` Come From?

`os` is a module in the Python standard
library. This means that it's basically a .py file with code in it that runs
when `os` is loaded by Python. I checked the source code out on
[GitHub](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.6/Lib/os.py).

I noted the
reference to POSIX in the comments at the top. What is POSIX? 

From
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX):

> The Portable Operating
System Interface (POSIX)[1] is a family of standards specified by the IEEE
Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX
defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line
shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of Unix
and other operating systems.[2][3]
> 
> Unix was selected as the basis for a
standard system interface partly because it was "manufacturer-neutral." However,
several major versions of Unix existed—so there was a need to develop a common
denominator system.

## 29. Reading `os` Documentation

Kunal just pointed us to the Python
documentation, which I have already been reading.

## 30. Quiz: Secret Message Mini-Project

Create your own secret message.
**Goal: spell out HELLO WORLD**

* Udacity provided a folder for download,
'alphabet,' containing one image for each letter of the alphabet in capital
letters. Space and period were also provided.
* [optional] write code to create
a new directory
* [optional] Copy files: need three 'L' (Chennai) and two 'O'
(Dallas). 
* Put files in desired order, and save to new directory 'alphabet1'
(manually in finder):
    1.  Bristol
    2.  Beijing
    3.  Chennai
    4.
Chennai
    5.  Dallas
    6.  Madrid
    7.  Jacksonville
    8.  Dallas
    9.
Gainesville
    10. Chennai
    11. Barcelona
* Rename files: instead of
removing numbers and keeping the letters, I decided to add numbers to the file
names, and then remove the letters.
    * I found the `ascii_lowercase[]` call
in the string package on [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3190122/python-how-to-print-range-
a-z), and used it to remove all letters. The second argument in the
`str.maketrans()` function was just 26 empty spaces.
* It worked! Unfortunately
though, my strategy resulted in the removal of the file extension. I included a
second `for` loop to add back jpg. 
* **Note that the print statements and
inclusion of the file lists as variables can be helpful for instructional
purposes, but aren't necessary.** Instead of creating a variable, the file list
can be referenced directly with `os.listdir()`. Also see [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16736080/change-the-file-
extension-for-files-in-a-folder-in-python).

```python
# draft code
# testing beginning of code with new folder
alphabet1_list = os.listdir('img/alphabet1')
print(alphabet1_list)

```

## 31. Edge Case

So far, we have been creating functions, and then writing code
line by line within the functions. We will continue to use this for our next
programming challenge, creating a movie website.

## 32. When Functions Do Not Suffice

* Functions may not be adequate when
operations get more complicated.
* If we want to pull up information about a
movie, we can't just manually type all the information into the Python function.
Instead, we should define a template. We could copy the template for each movie,
but what if we need to change it?
* Instead of a function, we are going to use
the `class` in Python to create the movie website.
