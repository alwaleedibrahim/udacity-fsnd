## 01. Course Map

We started off learning to build functions, but they weren't
adequate for making a movie website. We then used classes for three different
projects, turtles, text messages, and profanity ~~editor~~ checker. Now, we will
create classes in the movie website project. We will create a website that
displays our favorite movies, and then when the movie thumbnail is clicked on,
the trailer comes up from YouTube.

## 02.  Quiz: What Should Class Movie
Remember?

As we have learned, classes are like blueprints, and objects are like
specific instances of the blueprint.

It took me several tries to get the quiz
correct, because the question wasn't clear. The question was *Which of the
following data points should the `class` Movie remember?* I went with the bare
minimum, but I think they were basically looking for, *which of the following
data points relate to movies?*

```python
# things to remember
title
storyline
reviews
poster_image
youtube_trailer
# things to do
show_trailer()
```

I can
already see how we're going to build this. We will create a function for each
feature, and group the functions together into `class Movie`.

## 03. Defining Class Movie

* **It is good practice to define a class in one
file, and reference it in a separate file.** 
* **Class names should be written
in CapWords.** See [PEP8 naming
conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-
conventions) and Google Style Guide for Python.

*entertainment_center.py* will
reference the class created in *media.py*. 

*media.py*
```python
class Movie():
```
*entertainment_center.py*
```python
# import the media file, which contains
the class definition
import media
# create an object, or specific instance, of
the class Movie
toy_story = media.Movie()
```

## 04. Quiz: what happens when

I obviously got this one. `__init__` creates
space in memory for the new function.
> Great Job
>
> You got it! When we create
the instance brad, the init function inside the class Turtle gets called.

## 05. Defining __init__

**Note that I'm starting to write the python parts of
the code in Sublime Text.** The features I have set up make it faster and
easier. It's also easier to write Markdown in Sublime Text. Hopefully the
upcoming JupyterLab will bring together the best of Jupyter notebook with the
best of text editors like Sublime Text.

The autocomplete and PEP 8 checker in
the Anaconda Sublime package are very helpful. I had an error on the second line
of `def __init__` in *media.py*. It was PEP 8 E128. I did a quick search and
found the answer on [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15435811/what-is-
pep8s-e128-continuation-line-under-indented-for-visual-indent#15435837) and [PEP
8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation): need to indent to the
opening parenthesis.

The instructor Kunal's code is most definitely not PEP 8.
*media.py*
```python
class Movie():
    def __init__(self, movie_title,
movie_storyline, poster_image,
                 trailer_youtube):
self.title = movie_title
        self.storyline = movie_storyline
self.poster_image_url = poster_image
        self.trailer = trailer_youtube
pass
```
*entertainment_center.py*
```python
# import the media file, which
contains the class definition
import media
# create an object, or specific
instance, of the class Movie
toy_story = media.Movie(
    "Toy Story",
    "A
story of a boy and his toys that come to life",
"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/13/Toy_Story.jpg",
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwyZH85NQC4")
print(toy_story.storyline)
```

## 06. What Is Going On Behind The Scenes

## 07. Quiz: What Will Be the Output?

Adding another instance of class Movie.
The output will be printing the Avatar storyline.

## 08. Behind the Scenes

## 09. Is `self` important?

What if the word `self`
is removed from in front of storyline?

I said: Python will return an undefined
variable error -> *correct!*

## 10. Next up: show_trailer

## 11. Playing Movie Trailer

## 12. Quiz: Play
Your Favorite Trailer

**I anticipated the inclusion of this function and
already put it in my python code!**

Code so far:

*media.py* (unchanged)
```python
class Movie():
    def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline,
poster_image,
                 trailer_youtube):
        self.title =
movie_title
        self.storyline = movie_storyline
self.poster_image_url = poster_image
        self.trailer = trailer_youtube
pass
```
*entertainment_center.py*
```python
# Udacity full-stack web developer

# 01. Programming fundamentals and the web
# Lesson 09: Make classes:
movie website


# import the media file, which contains the class definition
import media
import webbrowser

# create an object, or specific instance, of the
class Movie
toy_story = media.Movie(
    "Toy Story",
    "A story of a boy and
his toys that come to life",
"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/13/Toy_Story.jpg",
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwyZH85NQC4")
print(toy_story.storyline)

# add
another instance
avatar = media.Movie(
    "Avatar",
    "A marine on an alien
planet",
    "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/Avatar-Teaser-
Poster.jpg",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0CDJZu4M5I")
print(avatar.storyline)
webbrowser.open_new_tab(avatar.trailer)
#
avatar.show_trailer() # another way

```

I uploaded a screenshot to the
discussion forum.

## 13. Recap Vocab
### **New vocabulary words:**

**Class**: A collection of
functions that can be called in specific instances.

**Constructor**: used to
indicate that a function is being built.

**Self**: when self is used in
`__init__(self):`, it refers to the object being created. We call it `self`
because it's like an example at this point that can be referenced in the future,
when creating a new instance of a class. Any word could be used, but `self` is a
useful convention. From [Python
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#random-remarks):
> Often, the first argument of a method is called self. This is nothing more
than a convention: the name self has absolutely no special meaning to Python.
Note, however, that by not following the convention your code may be less
readable to other Python programmers, and it is also conceivable that a class
browser program might be written that relies upon such a convention.
**Instance**: a specific use of a Class.

**Instance variables**: variables from
the Class that have been defined by the instance.

**Instance method**: a
function defined inside of a class and associated with an instance.

## 14. Designing the Movie Website

We are going to build a movie website! We
download the "fresh_tomatoes.py" file, which is basically a Bootstrap template
for the website.

### Instructor notes

Screenshot of all 6 instances of class
Movie:

<img src="img/entertainment-center-py-full.png" alt="Screenshot of the
entertainment.py file, containing all six instances of the class Movie"
width="75%">

Download the Python file
[fresh_tomatoes.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/master/fresh_tomatoes.py)
(make sure you save this file in the same folder as the python file where you
create your movie instances.)

## 15. Coding The Movie Website

Create an array
`movies` with all the movies in the file.

## 16. Quiz: Movie Website Mini-Project

### Readme

#### description

Server-side code written in Python to store a list
of my favorite movies, including artwork and trailers, then serve the data to a
local webpage with HTML and CSS.


#### noir

Film noir is one of my favorite
genres. I decided to include two classic noir films, two neo noir films (in the
film noir style, set in the noir era, but made more recently), and two future
noir films (containing elements of film noir, but set in the future). 

| Noir
era | Movie 1 | Date | Movie 2 | Date |
|:-------|:------|:------|:------|:------|
| *Classic Noir* | Double Indemnity |
1944 | Out of the Past | 1947 |
| *Neo Noir* | Chinatown | 1974 | Body Heat |
1981|
| *Future Noir* | Blade Runner | 1982 | The Terminator | 1984 |

### Debugging

* I was not able to get the code to run at first, like many
others. I had to change `self.trailer` to `self.trailer_youtube_url` in
*media.py*. 
* Some of the movie posters didn't come through at first either. I
had to change the wikipedia links to the corresponding upload.wikimedia.org
versions by clicking on the image again. 
* My subtitle was also sticking out
below the navbar. I was unsure how to change the navbar size, because we didn't
download a corresponding CSS with the *fresh_tomatoes.py* file. I think the CSS
is automatically referenced by Bootstrap. Instead of changing to a different
Bootstrap template, I just put the subtitle on the same line of the title, and
separated them with a pipe.

### Code review

I passed code review with only minor revisions. 

* Added a
docstring above the function definition in media.py to explain what the function
does
* Added a standardized header in the first three lines of each file
