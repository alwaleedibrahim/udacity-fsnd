## 01. Course Map

We're now moving on to the second part of Lesson 2: using
classes.

## 02. Send Text Messages (Story)

We will design a system for
automated sending of text messages. Cool!

## 03. Send Text Messages (Output)
The output sends automated text messages to his phone.

## 04. Introducing Twilio

`twilio` is a Python package that sends text messages
with Python code. It does not come with the Python standard library.

The PyPI
(Python Package Index) ranking site is down. According to [this
reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3bo3wc/what_happened_to_pypirankinginfo/),
the owner has had trouble maintaining the site. As alternatives, check out PyPI
directly, or the [Python 3 Wall of Superpowers](https://python3wos.appspot.com/)
(formerly Wall of Shame).

## 05. Download Twilio

I searched "twilio python" and found the [twilio SMS and
MMS python quickstart video](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python), and
the associated [guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/guides/how-to-send-sms-
messages-in-python). It was helpful. He had his account_sid, auth_token, and
phone number stored in environment variables with `os.environ[]`. He also made a
demo message about the Millenium Falcon in Star Wars!

### [install twilio
helper library with pip](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python)

Twilio
is included within the Pipenv. It can be installed with

```py
pip install
twilio
```

```py
import twilio
print(twilio.__version__)

```

## 09. Running Our Code

[Python Helper Library SMS
Test](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python)

The account_sid is like a
username, and the auth_token is like a password.

```python

from twilio.rest
import Client

# Your Account SID from twilio.com/console
account_sid = ""
#
Your Auth Token from twilio.com/console
auth_token  = ""

client =
Client(account_sid, auth_token)

message = client.messages.create(
    to="+", #
my mobile #
    from_="+14159038062", # twilio #
    body="Hello from Python!")
print(message.sid)

```

**It worked!**

## 10. Quiz: Python Keyword `From`

What does `from` do in Python? -> accesses
part of a Python module.

From Python documentation:

> As your program gets
longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You
may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs
without copying its definition into each program.
> 
> To support this, Python
has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an
interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module;
definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main
module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed
at the top level and in calculator mode).
> 
> Note that in general the practice
of importing * from a module or package is frowned upon, since it often causes
poorly readable code. However, it is okay to use it to save typing in
interactive sessions.

From [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710551/import-module-or-from-
module-import):

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The difference
between <code>import module</code> and <code>from module import foo</code> is
mainly subjective.  Pick the one you like best and be consistent in your use of
it.  Here are some points to help you decide.</p>

<p><code>import
module</code></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Less maintenance of
your <code>import</code> statements. Don't need to add any additional imports to
start using another item from the module</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Typing <code>module.foo</code> in your code
can be tedious and redundant (tedium can be minimized by using <code>import
module as mo</code> then typing <code>mo.foo</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><code>from module import foo</code></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Less typing to use <code>foo</code></li>
<li>More control over which
items of a module can be accessed</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong>
<ul>
<li>To use a new item from the module you have to update your
<code>import</code> statement</li>
<li>You lose context about <code>foo</code>.
For example, it's less clear what <code>ceil()</code> does compared to
<code>math.ceil()</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Either method is acceptable,
but <strong>don't</strong> use <code>from module import *</code>.  </p>

<p>For
any reasonable large set of code, if you <code>import *</code> you will likely
be cementing it into the module, unable to be removed.  This is because it is
difficult to determine what items used in the code are coming from 'module',
making it easy to get to the point where you think you don't use the
<code>import</code> any more but it's extremely difficult to be sure.</p>
</div>
[tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm)
> The
`from...import` Statement
> Python's from statement lets you import specific
attributes from a module into the current namespace. The from...import has the
following syntax −
> 
> `from modname import name1[, name2[, ... nameN]]`
> For
example, to import the function fibonacci from the module fib, use the following
statement −
> 
> `from fib import fibonacci`
> This statement does not import
the entire module fib into the current namespace; it just introduces the item
fibonacci from the module fib into the global symbol table of the importing
module.
> 
> The `from...import *` Statement:
> It is also possible to import
all names from a module into the current namespace by using the following import
statement −
> 
> `from modname import *`
> This provides an easy way to import
all the items from a module into the current namespace; however, this statement
should be used sparingly.

## 12. Where Does Twilio Come From?

`TwilioRestClient` is a class
within the `twilio.rest` module.

## 13. Connecting Turtle, Twilio and Classes

**Classes can be used as
blueprints to build repeated instances, or objects.** The activities performed
in each instance are defined inside the class.

## 14. Send Text Messages Mini-Project

Answer the following questions on the
discussion forum:

1. *What is a class?*
2. *What is an instance of a class?*
3.
*Thus far we have compared the class to a blueprint. Can you think of another
analogy to explain classes?*

My answers:

1. *What is a class?* -> a class is a
collection of functions written in Python code.
2. *What is an instance of a
class?* -> an instance is an specific adaptation of the code functions available
in a class.
3. *Thus far we have compared the class to a blueprint. Can you
think of another analogy to explain classes?* -> it's like a template that you
can fill in.
