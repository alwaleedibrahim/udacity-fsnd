## 01. Course Map

## 02. Drawing Turtles (Story)

Drawing shapes like squares,
circles, and fractals is one of the easiest ways to learn about classes.

## 03.
Drawing Turtles (Output)

The output will be a series of squares that rotate
around to form a circle.

## 04. Quiz: How to Draw a Square

*What instructions will you provide if Kunal
is walking around on a carpet trying to draw a square with his steps?*

1. walk
east 5 paces
2. walk south 5 paces
3. walk west 5 paces
4. walk north 5 paces
## 05. Drawing a Square

*Why is the Python function called turtle?* 

-> from
the [Python
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtles):
> Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming to kids. It was
part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and
Seymour Papert in 1966.
>
> Imagine a robotic turtle starting at (0, 0) in the
x-y plane. After an `import turtle`, give it the command `turtle.forward(15)`,
and it moves (on-screen!) 15 pixels in the direction it is facing, drawing a
line as it moves. Give it the command `turtle.right(25)`, and it rotates in-
place 25 degrees clockwise.

## 06. Change Turtle Shape, Color, and Speed

Note that in Jupyter notebook I
seem to be getting a turtle `Terminator` error every second time. It may still
be running in the notebook's Python kernel. Running the code in the shell also
works.

```python
import turtle


def draw_square():
    """Draw a square with
turtle graphics."""
    window = turtle.Screen()
    window.bgcolor('cyan')
brad = turtle.Turtle()
    brad.shape('turtle')
    brad.color('pink')
brad.speed(3)

    brad.forward(100)
    brad.right(90)
    brad.forward(100)
brad.right(90)
    brad.forward(100)
    brad.right(90)
    brad.forward(100)
brad.right(90)

    turtle.done()


draw_square()

```

## 07. Where Does Turtle Come From?

turtle (lowercase) is a module in the
Python standard library. 

Turtle (uppercase) is a class within the turtle
module.

A class is "a neatly packaged box, that puts things together really
well. Within `turtle.Turtle()` are various functions, like `def __init__`.

##
08. Reading Turtle Documentation

Already found
[it](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

## 09. Two Turtles

Adding a second turtle that starts where the first stops:
```python
import turtle


def draw_square_and_circle():
    """Draw a square and
circle with turtle graphics."""
    window = turtle.Screen()
window.bgcolor('cyan')

    brad = turtle.Turtle()
    brad.shape('turtle')
brad.color('pink')
    brad.speed(3)

    brad.forward(100)
    brad.right(90)
brad.forward(100)
    brad.right(90)
    brad.forward(100)
    brad.right(90)
brad.forward(100)
    brad.right(90)

    angie = turtle.Turtle()
angie.shape('arrow')
    angie.color('blue')
    angie.circle(100)
turtle.done()


draw_square_and_circle()

```

## 10. What's Wrong With This Code?

My answer: *Not efficient - lots of
repeats. Should include loops.*

Correct. Repetitive lines of code, and the name
of the function needs to be changed now that we also draw a circle.

## 11.
Quiz: Improving Code Quality


There is no triangle function, but you can draw
two lines and then a diagonal one connecting them by returning to the home
position.

```python
import turtle


def draw_shapes():
    """Draw shapes with
turtle graphics."""
    window = turtle.Screen()
    window.bgcolor('cyan')
# Draw square
    brad = turtle.Turtle()
    brad.shape('turtle')
brad.color('pink')
    brad.speed(3)

    for i in range(0, 4):
brad.forward(100)
        brad.right(90)

    # Draw circle
    angie =
turtle.Turtle()
    angie.shape('arrow')
    angie.color('blue')
angie.circle(100)

    # Draw extra credit triangle
    beavis = turtle.Turtle()
beavis.color('brown')
    beavis.backward(300)
    beavis.left(90)
beavis.backward(300)
    beavis.home()

    turtle.done()


draw_shapes()

```

##  12. Quiz: What is a Class?

A class is like a blueprint. The objects or
instances are like examples of the blueprint.

## 13 Quiz: Making a Circle out of Squares

```python
import turtle


def
draw_square(some_turtle):
    """Draw a square with turtle graphics."""
    for
i in range(0, 4):
        some_turtle.forward(100)
        some_turtle.right(90)
def many_squares():
    """Use turtle graphics to form a circle out of many
squares."""
    window = turtle.Screen()
    window.bgcolor('cyan')

    brad =
turtle.Turtle()
    brad.shape('turtle')
    brad.color('pink')
brad.speed(3)
    for i in range(0, 36):
        draw_square(brad)
brad.right(10)

    turtle.done()


many_squares()

```

## 14. Quiz: Turtle Mini-Project

I created a colorful spiral, transporting the
viewer into the Tron game grid. The background image is from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tron_Lightcycles.jpg#/media/File:Tron_Lightcycles.jpg).

```python
import turtle
import colorsys


def spiral_into_the_grid():
    """Use turtle graphics to create a colorful spiral."""
    turtle.setup(width=1600, height=900)
    turtle.speed(0)
    turtle.hideturtle()
    window = turtle.Screen()
    window.bgpic('img/TRON.gif')

    for i in range(1250):
        colors = colorsys.hsv_to_rgb(i / 1250, 1.0, 1.0)
        turtle.color(colors)
        turtle.forward(i)
        turtle.left(115)

    turtle.done()


spiral_into_the_grid()

```

## 15. Quiz: Comfort Level

How comfortable am I with writing computer programs?
I said 3 - "somewhat comfortable." This is what I said before beginning the
module. I have learned to write some simple programs, but need more training
before I can write anything complex or original. Based on the project
submissions from other students in the discussion forum, my competency and
originality are above-average.

## 16. They Look So Similar

Kunal explained
something that was difficult for him to understand in college. Calling classes
and calling functions look similar. 

`webbrowser.open()` calls a function.
`turtle.Turtle()` actually calls an init function within the class turtle.

##
Appendix

**I was wondering if Python was used for more advanced graphics
applications. On the [Python homepage](https://www.python.org/), I came across a
[testimonial](https://www.python.org/success-stories/industrial-light-magic-
runs-python/) by Tim Fortenberry, Industrial Light & Magic, about how they use
Python for their image processing workflow:**

> ILM runs a batch processing
environment capable of modeling, rendering and compositing tens of thousands of
motion picture frames per day. Thousands of machines running Linux, IRIX, Compaq
Tru64, OS X, Solaris, and Windows join together to provide a production pipeline
used by ~800 users daily. Speed of development is key, and Python was a faster
way to code (and re-code) the programs that control this production pipeline.
