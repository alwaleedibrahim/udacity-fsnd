## 01. What will we create?
    
Kunal, Udacity instructor

1. project take a
break

2. project profanity editor

3. project movie database

*I stopped here
for a bit to review basic python and drill loops and if statements. See
[Appendix](#appendix) below for some examples.*

## 02. Quiz: comfort level

*
Kunal said that in his computer science classes, students often started out
interested, but became frustrated after the difficulty level skyrocketed.
* I
chose 3, somewhat comfortable, with writing computer programs.
    
## 03. What
should I know?

## 04. Quiz: test for loops

They had a dance video shaking shoulders to the
left and right three times.

**I didn't really agree with the answer, so I re-
coded it myself:**

```python
# Python for loops quiz
# I would actually code it like this:

num_1 = 1

while(num_1 <= 3):
    print('shake shoulders to the left')
    print('shake shoulders to the right')
    # omission of the line below may result in an infinite loop.
    num_1 = num_1 + 1 
print('Strike a pose')
```

## 05. Quiz: Test for If Statements

I drilled if-else statements for a while
(see conditionals section below). I understood this immediately! Very happy with
my syntax progress.

```python
def determine_direction(message):
    if message == 'TAKE THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED':
        print('Turn left')
    elif message == 'COMFORT IS DIVINE':
        print('Turn right')
    else:
        print('Stop here')
        
determine_direction('TAKE THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED')
```

## 06. What Will We Learn?

Somewhat familiar ideas: lesson 0 and 1

* Functions
like `print('Hello, World!')`

New ideas: lesson 2 and 3

* Classes
* Object-
oriented programming

## Appendix

### Selection of jupyter notebook

* This nanodegree will use Python.
* Jupyter
allows both markdown and inline code chunks in the same notebook.
* It is easier
to write Markdown in Sublime, but jupyter is a better choice because of the
coding functionality.
* The ability to run individual cells is useful for both
code and markdown. Rendering Markdown is quicker than knitting an entire
document with Rstudio, or using Markdown Preview with Sublime.
* Rstudio has
some similar features, but jupyter has support for more coding languages.
*
Jupyter is also useful for research because of checkpoint/version control and
collaboration features. It is a good idea to get used to jupyter so I can use it
for collaborative, reproducible research in the future.

See
[GitHub](https://github.com/br3ndonland/general/blob/master/br3ndonland_terminal.md)
for more info on my computer setup.

### User input
I worked on this later, out of interest.

```python
name = input("Please type your name: ")
# Old syntax
print('Yo yo yo', name + '!', 'My new album just dropped!')
# Python 3 string formatting
print("Yo yo yo {}! My new album just dropped!".format(name))
```

### Loops

```python
# looping examples
## simple example from GA_python101
### this example prints each letter of the reference string `phrase` in turn, as uppercase

phrase = 'Happy Birthday!' # establish a reference

for letter in phrase: # perform the following for each letter in the phrase
    print(letter.upper()) # print the letter as uppercase
```

```python
integers_2 = range(1, 16)

for x in integers_2:
    print(x)
```

```python
# looping examples
## example from Harvard Computefest Intro to Python 2017 python-cf17-02-language.ipynb

colors = 'red green blue yellow white black pink'.split()
print(colors)
for c in colors:
    print('color is', c)
```

A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a
target statement as long as a given condition is true.

```python
num_1 = 1

while(num_1 <= 3):
    print('shake shoulders to the left')
    print('shake shoulders to the right')
    num_1 = num_1 + 1 # omission of this line may result in an infinite loop.
else:
    print('Strike a pose.')
```

**To stop an infinite loop in jupyter, press `Esc` to enter command mode, and
then `i,i` to interrupt the kernel.**

### Conditionals

```python
# Conditionals (if statements)

## simple example from GA_python101

secret = 55
value = 55

if secret == value:
    print('they are equal')
else:
    print('they are not equal')
```

```python
## more complicated example
###
### not sure how to do this with a range, like:
### integers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]
### integers = range(1, 15)
integer = 15

if integer == 1:
    print('this number is one')
elif integer == 10:
    print('this number is ten')
elif integer == 15:
    print('Finally! This number is fifteen!')
else:
    print('End of line.')
```

### Functions

```python
# Functions
## factorial example from [repl.it](https://repl.it)
### try running it with 0 and 7 as the inputs in the last line.

def factorial(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
factorial(7)
```

```python
# Functions
## example from Harvard Computefest Intro to Python 2017 
## python-cf17-02-language.ipynb

def say_hi(me):
    print("Yo {}!".format(me))

me = "br3ndonland"
say_hi(me)

def f(x):
    "A function f of x that calculates a second order function for y and also z"
    y = 3*x + 2*x**2
    z = 5*x**2 + 4*y**(0.5)
    return y, z # tuple packing

f(4)
```

```python
# Functions
## example from Harvard Computefest Intro to Python 2017 
## python-cf17-02-language.ipynb
## Function exercise
## * Create a list of 10 numbers, your choice.
## * Use a `for` loop to iterate over it.
## * Think about what you'd need to do to calculate the average
## * Remember the `len()` function.

number_list = [1, -594, 90, 45, 7, 3, 59, 9087, 4, 2]

def myaverage(numlist):
    'calculate the mean from an iterable of numbers'
    print('given numlist:', numlist)
    total = 0
    for x in numlist:
        total += x
    mean = total / float(len(numlist))
    print("Got a mean of", mean)
    return mean
average = myaverage(number_list)
average
```

```python
# Functions
## that was a very time-consuming way of calculating an average.
## (in human time, not computer time)
## how about this
import statistics
statistics.mean(number_list)
```

```python
# numpy is also faster for humans, but imports a larger package
# so may take longer for the computer.
import numpy

numpy.mean(number_list)

```
