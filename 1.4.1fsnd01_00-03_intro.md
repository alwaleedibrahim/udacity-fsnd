# Lesson 01. Welcome

## Intro

Miriam Swords Kalk, nanodegree student experience


## Readiness assessment

*When the going gets tough, what motivates you?*

*Online learning is a journey and we're here to help. Tell us more about how you stay motivated to work through challenges.*

> **Personal improvement. Growth keeps me going.**
> 
> **Long-term goals. I want to improve science with new technology tools. I need to develop the skills to make this happen.**

-> *I have written about this before, but should consolidate my writings on motivation. See Life as a scientist.docx about remembering your purpose etc.*

**The readiness assessment suggested the intro to programming nanodegree, but I will keep going. I have an advanced educational background, experience, and I don't have time to complete both the intro to programming and full-stack web developer nanodegrees before I get a job. If I get stuck, I will go through a period of intense focused learning until I have the necessary competency. I will also complement my Udacity training with in-person events whenever possible.**

Feedback to Udacity: 

>Thank you for this introduction, and for offering the readiness assessment! I appreciate your thoughtfulness and consideration.

# Lesson 02: career services available to you

This will be very helpful. I can refine my resume and search for jobs while completing my degree.

I have updated my profile with current information.

# Lesson 03: nanodegree orientation

## 01. welcome to orientation

## 02. projects and progress

* Udacity focuses on learning by doing.
* The program is built around projects. Reviewing all the course material isn't a requirement for graduation. 
    
## 03. connecting with your community

* I joined the Slack channel.
* Hi everyone! I'm Brendon Smith. I have a PhD in nutrition and have been a postdoc researcher and lab manager at Harvard for two years now. I want to build new technology tools to make science more efficient and reproducible. I have experience with R, Python, Git, and front-end web development. Some of my friends at MIT told me about Udacity. I'm looking forward to learning here with all of you! 

## 04. support

## 05. project submission

## 06. integrity and mindset

The Honor Code:

>*I hereby confirm that all my project submissions consist of my own work. Accordingly, I will document and cite the origins of any part(s) of my project submissions that were taken from websites, books, forums, GitHub repositories, or any other source and explain why I used them for any part of my submission. I understand that I may be asked to explain my work in a video call with a Udacity Mentor before my Nanodegree graduation is conferred.*

## 07. finding time to study

* They recommend ≥10 hrs / week in ≥2 blocks. I set it aside, though I will basically be working full-time right now.

## 08. final tips

* "Be relentless in searching for an answer on your own."
* Be an active member of your community. Help other students.
