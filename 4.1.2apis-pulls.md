Greetings Udacious Humans!

I humbly submit these suggested updates to the README in the APIs repository. As suggested in Udacity's [Git course](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123), I created a topic branch for this pull request, and changed the file with a series of small, focused commits. Each item in the list below represents a separate commit.

* Format README.md for Markdown
* Update course info
* Rearrange Python package list alphabetically
* Remove redis installation instructions
* Add optional virtual machine configuration
* Add Table of Contents
* Add hyperlinked Udacity logo

This merge would supersede the following open pull requests:

* add spaces to fix formatting #30
* update README's format #31
* small update. #35
