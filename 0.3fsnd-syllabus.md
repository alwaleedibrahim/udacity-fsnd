## Full Stack Curriculum

In this Nanodegree program, you'll learn how to build and manage relational databases to store and handle application data, and build powerful server-side applications to serve that data to any type of client-side application.

Youâ€™ll learn to build applications that can support any front-end, and scale to support hundreds of thousands of users.

**4 Months to complete, 160 hours total** (10 hours/week x 16 weeks)

### Prerequisite Knowledge

To enroll, you should have experience with Python Programming (or another object-oriented programming language), Programming with JavaScript, Git/GitHub, HTML basics, and Data Structures including Lists, Arrays, Dictionaries.See detailed requirements.

### Developer Fundamentals

Brush up on your knowledge of essential developers' tools such as the Unix shell, Git, and Github; then apply your skills to investigate HTTP, the web's fundamental protocol.

### Databases with SQL and Python

Master relational databases with the power of SQL, and leverage Python to incorporate database logic into your programs.

#### Project: Logs Analysis

Analyze data from the logs of a web service to answer questions such as "What is the most popular page?" and "When was the error rate high?" using advanced SQL queries.

### Servers, Authorization, and CRUD

Build multi-user web applications using the Flask framework, SQLAlchemy, and authentication providers such as Google.

#### Project: Item Catalog

Develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories, as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit, and delete their own items.

### Deploying to Linux Servers

Deploy your web applications onto Linux servers. Learn the essentials of securing and configuring Linux web servers, then deploy a full stack application to a live server with a database and routing.

#### Project: Linux Server Configuration

Take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications; this will include installing updates, thereby securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.
